# Data Science Portfolio
Portfolio of data science projects completed by me for self learning and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of Jupyter notebook.

_Note: Data used in the projects (accessed under data directory) is for demonstration purposes only._

## Instructions for Running Python Notebooks Locally
* Run notebooks as usual by using a jupyter notebook server, Vscode etc.

## Contents

- ### Machine Learning

	- [Predicting Texas Government Salaries]: A model to predict Who are the outliers in the salaries? What roles make more than they would outside? What departments/roles have the biggest wage disparities between managers and employees? Have salaries and total compensations for some roles/departments/head-count changed over time utilizing machine learning.
	- [Supervised Learning: predict Multilabel Problem with H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines]: Testing out several different supervised learning algorithms to build a predictive model for studying the future trends of vaccine for any particular diseases.

   _Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Numpy_
  
- ### Data Analysis and Visualisation
 
	- [Exploratory data analysis: Food Waste Depth analysis]: Analyzing a dataset containing data on Food Waste. This dataset includes, by country, both household, retail, and food services estimates of food waste as well as other data points.
	- [Auto Libraries: Applying auto libraries on datasets]: Automatically visualizing dataset

  _Tools: Pandas, Seaborn, Autoviz, Pandas profiling and Matplotlib_ 
  
- ### Natural Language Processing

	- [Natural Language processing: Fake and real news using NLTK](https://github.com/AbhiG-06/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/fake-real-news-prediction.ipynb):  Classifying the news using NLTK and naive bayes algorithm to determine if an article is fake news or not.

	_Tools: NLTK, scikit_
